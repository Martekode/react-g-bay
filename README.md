Personally I think that both time and to little base knowledge on all the techniques we had to use are what negatively impacted our project the most.
Connecting front- and backend together for the first time without any decent experience was a big task on its own, without having to make a multiple page application involving more other techniques.
Brian had no experience as a scrum master and found it hard to jump in other peoples code which is understandable of course! None of us had experience as a 'scrum master'.
Al so myself being sick for multiple days made it hard for myself to pick up the pace again and seeing where we stand or knowing which part had to be done still.

Some prior project combining some of the new implementations we had to use for this project. (f.e. auth0, routing in react, etc).

so the combination of time, not enough resources (as in people, due to illness) and not enough experience/knowledge on the things we had to use/do.
