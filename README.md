    Ik vond het een zeer goede opdracht en een leuk project. Hierdus mijn post-mortem:
    Als we allen een beetje meer knowledge hadden over wat er te verwachten staat bij een project van deze scope.
    Door het gebrek van die knowledge voelen de members hen wat oblivious over het andere deel van het project.
    Alles considered, meer practice should do the trick.

In my experience we had a strong coding group, although we still all struggled very hard with some concepts.  
The beginning was pretty rough on us, but so is every beginning, am I right?  
Once we got started, me as the backend developer in this project, together with Yasser did a lot of research before we actually did any coding,  
which made things like the DB connection and the actual coding less of a hassle than it could have been in my opinion.  
The major point we could work on as a team was the ticketing system, we tried, don't get me wrong, but this system only survived the first couple of days.  

All in all I am very grateful for my team and the learning opportunities I had during this assignment,  
and I think we can be proud on the product we delivered.

Personally I think that both time and to little base knowledge on all the techniques we had to use are what negatively impacted our project the most.
Connecting front- and backend together for the first time without any decent experience was a big task on its own, without having to make a multiple page application involving more other techniques.
Brian had no experience as a scrum master and found it hard to jump in other peoples code which is understandable of course! None of us had experience as a 'scrum master'.
Al so myself being sick for multiple days made it hard for myself to pick up the pace again and seeing where we stand or knowing which part had to be done still.

Some prior project combining some of the new implementations we had to use for this project. (f.e. auth0, routing in react, etc).

so the combination of time, not enough resources (as in people, due to illness) and not enough experience/knowledge on the things we had to use/do.
